  Synopsis:

	Provides a direct interface into the Cepstral
      	text-to-speech engine for Asterisk eliminating
 	the need to write audio output files to the 
	filesystem and then stream them back out.

 	Also provides multi-digit dtmf recognition with
	a max digits and a wait-for-digit timer very 
	simular to the AGI 'get data' command.


  Requirements: 

	- Asterisk development header files
	- Cepstral Swift engine, libraries or framework

  Installation: 
                
	check the makefile to be sure paths are correct
	check that the swift libraries are in your ld path
	unpack
	make
	make install (as root / sudo)

  Usage:	

	Type "core show application swift" at the CLI prompt.
